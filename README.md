# python-madness

in order to learn python, i redid the csds 233 assignments but in python instead of java.  i think that this went pretty well, considering i had only known python for a few days at this point.  there's a base converter that goes from 2 - 36, back and forth.  i also wrote command-line blackjack so that i could learn how classes and objects worked in python.
